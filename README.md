### coding done in _Ubuntu_

### Coding language: C

Pre-requisites: 

1: Understanding of trees

2: structures

3: pointers

4: functions

5: Object files and executable files





### It is implemented in 4 different files

1: BSTHeader.h:: Header file which contains the function's prototype of all the required functions

2: BSTFunctions.c:: It contains all function definitions like insertions, deletion, etc.

3: BSTMain.c:: It is a menu-driven program that calls all the functions according to the user's choice.

4: makefile:: Every time we make some changes in either of the files we have to make an object file again. makefile helps us to update the object file 


### Directives to use makefile: 

in cmd and in the directory where all the 4 files are present type "make" and hit enter... it will create all the required files
then to see the outputs type ./exeBST 

enjoy :)
